Canteen Hub+
🚩 Problem Statement
At St. Xavier's Engineering College, every day at 10:30 AM, over 200 students rush to the canteen. Due to a manual ordering system and lack of demand prediction, this results in:

Long queues (up to 45 minutes)

Meals running out before 12:50 PM

No pre-ordering options

Food wastage or shortages (approx. ₹2,400/day loss)

Payment tracking in a worn notebook (₹15,000+ pending dues)

Students forced to spend ₹180+ outside when the ₹40 meals run out

Chandrettan (the canteen in-charge) operating on guesswork and facing chaos daily
